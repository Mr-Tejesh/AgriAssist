# AgriAssist
AgriAssist is a code name for the device I built as project in my last semester

The aim of the project is to build an affordable device which monitors the climatic conditions of remote agriculture fields for better farming. In addition to weather monitoring the device also has irrigation support. Whenever the moisture content in soil decreases than the threshold value for a certain crop, water is pumped into field automatically without human intervention.

Hardware used is : i.ESP32
                  ii.DHT11
                 iii.Soil Moisture sensor
                  iv.Rain sensor
                   v.Nokia 5510 display
                  vi.5V DC pump
                 vii.Relay
                 
                
Software used is : Arduino IDE with ESP32 board configurations
